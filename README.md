# Image-captioning
This project generates natural language captions for images using a traditional deep learning pipeline. It extracts image features using a pre-trained VGG16 model and feeds them into an LSTM-based decoder to generate captions. Built with TensorFlow/Keras and trained on the Flickr8k dataset
